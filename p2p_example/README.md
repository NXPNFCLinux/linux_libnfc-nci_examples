p2p_example
================
This example demonstrates NDEF message exchange, in both way) in p2p mode using the linux_libnfc-nci library.
For proper demonstration while using Android phone as peer device, the example waits for 3 seconds before pushing the NDEF message,
allowing user to send NDEF content (via "Beam" functionality) meanwhile.

More information about the linux_libnfc-nci library can be found in AN11697: https://www.nxp.com/doc/AN11697
